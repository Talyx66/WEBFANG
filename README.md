# WEBFANG
This is my very first Command-line interface tool I have developed, engineered for blue-teamers, red-teamers, bug hunters, or for research & study purposes, use legally and ethically.

**Open "webfang_gui.py" for graphical user interface mode**
  
**WebFang** is an OSINT + Reconnaissance toolkit for ethical hackers and red teamers.
It performs passive and active recon using spidering, WHOIS, DNS, Shodan, and header fingerprinting.
